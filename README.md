## Automatic deployment

You can automatically deploy the worker + GCS + global scheduler nodes by doing:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Reset by doing ^C and then running `docker-compose down` to make sure all the containers are killed.


## Run a single node

To run a single Ray node, just do `./run.sh`. This will put you into a shell, and then you can run something like:

```bash
./go/bin/worker
```

and this will just launch the "worker" Go service. You should see something like:

```
root@fc8df146bfc1:/app# ./go/bin/worker
2024/04/27 00:55:59 server listening at [::]:50002
```

Remember to do ^D to exit the Docker container interactive session.


## Getting Started (manual)

Install everything you need first.

```
brew install go
brew install protobuf
go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@latest
go install google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc@latest
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
pip install grpcio-tools
```


Then, run:
```
make all
```

This will compile all the Go server files and generate the Python/Go gRPC stub code.

Then, run
```
./go/bin/driver
```

This will start up the driver server.

Finally, run:

```
python3 python/babyray/client.py
```

This will run the Python client that will talk to the driver server.


## Using the Python package

Go to the `python/` directory and do `python3 -m pip install -e .` (or just `pip install -e .`, depending on whether you like the Python executable that your pip is attached to).


Then, go to some arbitrary place on your computer, and you can run this script with Python.
```
import babyray
babyray.init()  # initialize in the same way as the real Ray does

@babyray.remote
def f(x):
    return x * x

futures = [f.remote(i) for i in range(4)]
print(babyray.get(futures))  # [0, 1, 4, 9]
```

It doesn't work right now because it hits an error when it tries to query the local scheduler (which doesn't exist),
but this will start working once we implement all the Go stuff.


## File structure

file structure is kinda like:
